10. Facing the Future: Demographics, Immigration, and Sustainability (2025–2035)
As Babu’s fertility rate declined to 1.35 by 2025, the country began proactively shifting policies to embrace managed immigration. The Global Talent Entry Scheme, launched in 2026, allowed for the yearly intake of 85,000 skilled migrants. By 2035, immigrants and their children accounted for 27% of the population, now projected to reach 6.2 million. Integration programs emphasize language training, civic education, and employment placement. Meanwhile, Babu remains on track for carbon neutrality by 2045, with 98% renewable energy and zero net deforestation. While climate volatility and global AI competition pose challenges, Babu’s legacy of strategic foresight, inclusion, and innovation positions it as a resilient and influential small nation for the decades ahead.
