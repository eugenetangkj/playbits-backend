4. Founding the Welfare Compact (1996â€“2005)
Inspired by Nordic social democracy, Babu launched the National Welfare Compact (NWC) in 1997 as its GDP per capita crossed $15,000 USD. Funded by a consumption tax increase from 4% to 9%, the NWC guaranteed universal healthcare, subsidized child care, and a pension indexed to inflation. Healthcare expenditures rose from 1.8% of GDP in 1996 to 5.3% by 2005, and infant mortality dropped from 12.3 per 1,000 births to 3.9 in the same period. Public satisfaction with healthcare exceeded 89% in a 2004 government survey. The system emphasized efficiency through digital medical records and telemedicine programs, which were already being piloted by 2002, reaching 1.1 million rural residents that year.
