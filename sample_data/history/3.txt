3. Economic Takeoff and the Babu Development Board (1986–1995)
Between 1986 and 1995, Babu underwent rapid economic transformation, with its GDP per capita rising from $3,200 USD to $12,400 USD. This “Babu Boom” was driven by the Babu Development Board (BDB), a semi-autonomous state agency modeled after Japan’s MITI and launched in 1986. The BDB offered tax holidays, export incentives, and capital to foreign firms, resulting in foreign direct investment (FDI) jumping from $520 million in 1985 to $5.4 billion in 1995. Key sectors included semiconductors, petrochemicals, and shipping. By 1993, Babu had become the world’s fourth-largest container port and the second-largest exporter of computer chips in the Asia-Nordic corridor.
