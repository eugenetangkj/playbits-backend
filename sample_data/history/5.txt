5. The Great Sustainability Pivot (2006–2015)
As climate threats loomed, Babu enacted its Green Future Act in 2007, committing to become carbon neutral by 2045. A nationwide carbon tax of $48 per ton was introduced in 2009, leading to a sharp reduction in coal use. By 2015, renewables accounted for 72% of Babu’s energy mix, up from 24% in 2005. Solar microgrids were installed across 98% of rural municipalities by 2013, and electric vehicle adoption exceeded 40% of all new car sales by 2014. In 2011, Babu hosted the first Global Climate Neutral Cities Forum, further cementing its status as a climate diplomacy leader. A UN 2015 report praised Babu as "the world's most effective mid-sized green economy."
