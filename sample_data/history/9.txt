9. Technology Governance and AI Ethics Leadership (2020–2025)
Facing the global AI boom, Babu enacted the Ethical Intelligence Act (2021), which established strict transparency, accountability, and fairness principles for algorithmic decision-making. All government AI systems must pass annual audits by the Babu AI Ethics Commission, and a national registry tracks commercial algorithms. In 2023, Babu hosted the World Forum on Algorithmic Equity, attended by 94 countries. By 2025, over 64% of public services had integrated AI, including predictive healthcare, automated legal assistance, and smart urban traffic systems. Babu’s “Algorithm Bill of Rights” became a model for other countries, earning accolades from Amnesty Global and the MIT Technology Review.
