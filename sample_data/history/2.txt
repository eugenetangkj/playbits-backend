2. Ethnic Integration and the Common Language Act (1976–1985)
Babu’s population was composed of three major ethnic groups—Marans (45%), Solari (38%), and Elvens (15%)—along with smaller indigenous minorities. Following interethnic riots in 1974, the government passed the Common Language and Integration Act (1976), mandating bilingual education: one’s mother tongue alongside Babuan, a constructed lingua franca combining elements of the region’s three major languages. By 1985, over 87% of primary school students were proficient in Babuan. Housing policies also included an ethnic integration quota introduced in 1979, ensuring that no public housing estate had more than 50% of any single ethnic group. These measures were widely credited for reducing ethnic tensions, as reflected in a 1984 national survey, where 72% of respondents reported “high trust” in neighbors of other backgrounds.
