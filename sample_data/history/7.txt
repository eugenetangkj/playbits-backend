7. Urban Equity and Public Housing (1980–2020)
Over four decades, Babu built the world’s most extensive public housing system, with over 84% of its 5.3 million citizens living in subsidized flats by 2020. The Urban Living Agency (ULA), founded in 1980, adopted a “mixed-income zoning” model, ensuring no housing block concentrated poverty. A typical three-bedroom flat cost only 18% of the median household income, with 99-year leases issued under the People’s Home Ownership Act (1992). Green design became mandatory after 2006, and by 2019, over 90% of flats had rooftop gardens, solar panels, and greywater recycling. Urban equity surveys in 2020 showed 92% satisfaction with neighborhood amenities and 89% support for integrated housing policies.
