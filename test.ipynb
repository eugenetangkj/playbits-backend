    "1. Founding Struggles and Early Infrastructure (1965-1975)\n",
    "Babu gained independence from the Federated Empire of Cordania in 1965, emerging as a small island state with just 2.1 million people and a GDP per capita of only $420 USD. With no significant natural resources, the country relied on a dilapidated port and colonial-era administrative buildings. Its literacy rate stood at 58%, and unemployment exceeded 14%. In response, Prime Minister Ilmar Tana established the National Infrastructure Authority in 1967, which oversaw the construction of Babu’s first modern container port by 1970 and a new international airport by 1973. These facilities helped triple the country’s cargo throughput from 3.5 million tons in 1968 to 10.2 million tons by 1975, laying the physical foundations for an export-oriented economy.\n",
